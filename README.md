# Nested reactive forms in Angular tutorial

## Description

This project has been created to accompany my [Nested reactive forms in Angular tutorial](https://youtu.be/DEuTcG8DxUI) video.

In the video we build a simple contacts list that allows the user to add up to 3 contact items, each containing a name and email address.  
The topics that we cover in the video are:
- Nesting reactive forms
- Passing form data between components
- Form control getters
- Simple form validation


## Branches
- master - Contains the basic project markup & styles. _(This is the project that I start with at the beginning of the video)._
- version/with-form-logic - The finished product with the logic that we write during the video


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Angular version

10.0.14
